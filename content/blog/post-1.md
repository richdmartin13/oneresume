OneResume is now live! We're a digital resume platform that brings what's important into focus - you and your accomplishments. We strive to offer something different than LinkedIn: a personal space on the web where your experience truly shines, free from distraction.

Here's how it works: you send us your resume, and we create a digital version that you can share with anyone. You can even put it on your own resume! If you don't already have a resume, we'll be happy to suggest some experienced resume writers that we work with to bring your skills into focus. Sadly, we can't help you with that part; we'll leave that to the professionals!

We're excited to see what the future will bring for you, and us. Be sure to check back here every once and a while to see what's new!
